## Block/BID design decisions (strict)

These are confirmed in #linx-core (2026-02-24) and must be preserved by future changes:

1) **BID is generated by BROB**
- BID is the BROB entry identity.
- Default sizing: BROB is parameterized; **default entries = 128**.

2) **BID encoding**
- Keep 64-bit BID.
- `slot_id = BID[6:0]` (for 128 entries)
- `uniq = BID[63:7]` (debug uniqueness / age ordering)
- So: `BID = (uniq << 7) | slot_id`

3) **Tag routing**
- **cmd_tag = BID[7:0]**
- Rationale: PE response tags must route to the correct BROB entry; avoid any unrelated tag sources (e.g. cycles).

4) **Block completion**
- `complete = scalar_done && (needs_engine ? engine_done : 1)`
- `needs_engine` should be set when the block actually issues engine commands.

5) **BSTART / BSTOP semantics**
- `BSTART` uop in ROB carries the **new BID** (it belongs to the new block).
- `scalar_done` is triggered at **BSTART retire + BSTOP retire**.
  - On BSTART retire: mark scalar_done for the *old active bid* (implicit end).
  - On BSTOP retire: mark scalar_done for the current active bid (explicit end).

6) **Flush semantics (BID-based)**
- On a flush/redirect, the system reports the **current block BID** (the block where the flush is generated).
- All blocks **younger than this BID** must be cleared.
- Because slot ids wrap, comparisons must use full 64-bit BID ordering.
- Rule: **keep `bid <= flush_bid`, kill `bid > flush_bid`**.
- This applies to **all modules that carry/queue BID** (at minimum: BROB + BISQ + any other bid-carrying queues).

## PR checklist for BID/block changes

- [ ] Confirm `cmd_tag == bid[7:0]` through backend->bctrl->PE and response routing.
- [ ] Confirm flush path provides `flush_bid` and every bid-carrying module kills `bid > flush_bid`.
- [ ] Confirm BROB keeps `bid <= flush_bid` (including current block) and handles wrap via uniq bits.
- [ ] Update docs/skills when new edge cases are discovered.

## Issue Queue + speculative ready + load-miss cancel (strict)

Confirmed in #linx-core (2026-02-24). This section is the checklist to avoid forgetting.

### Ready table vs speculative ready

- `ready_table[P-ptag]` is **1-bit per P-ptag** and is **non-spec ready**:
  - must only be set when the value is guaranteed **not** to be cancelled.
  - used by uops after enqueue to query readiness.
- `issq` must track **speculative readiness** per operand, with an `is_spec` marker.

### Pick/issue/commit model

- Wakeup must **not** affect pick in the same cycle (timing constraint):
  - wakeup @ cycle N → pick can only observe it at cycle N+1.
- `issq` entries must not be deallocated while cancellable.
  - Implement an `inflight` lock bit:
    - P1: `pick` sets `inflight=1` (entry remains valid).
    - Cancel: clears `inflight=0` (entry stays valid).
    - **Dealloc point is I2**: only clear `valid` when the uop is confirmed non-cancellable.
- Age/oldest-ready ordering must be preserved across `inflight`:
  - inflight entries are simply ineligible; their age does not change.

### Load speculative wakeup + forward + miss

- Load produces **spec-wakeup at LD_E1** (no data).
- Load returns **data only at LD_E4**.
- Consumers that become ready only via load spec-wakeup:
  - must not request RF read ports in I1 for that src;
  - must obtain data via **E4→consumer-I2 forward**, reusing the bypass network (match by P-ptag).

### ld_gen_vec

- `ld_gen_vec` is a **bitset** (not onehot), representing load pipeline stages E1–E4.
- It must propagate along dependency chains.
- Load pipeline advances `ld_gen_vec` via bit-shift as it moves through stages.

### Miss-pending suppression

- LSU provides `miss_pending` (derived from E4 miss detection) that stays asserted until LIQ restarts the load after refill and the load returns via the hit path.
- While `miss_pending==1`, issue queues must suppress picking entries whose `src.ld_gen_vec` contains `LD_E4`.

### Config hook (optional)

- Keep a top-level `CoreCfg` hook for an alternative implementation that delays miss visibility to E5 (would require extending `ld_gen_vec` to 5 bits). Default is the E4 scheme above.

## When merging LinxCore PRs

After merging to `LinxISA/LinxCore`, bump the superproject gitlink:

- `/home/zhoubot/linx-isa` → update `rtl/LinxCore` submodule pointer on `main`, PR + merge.
